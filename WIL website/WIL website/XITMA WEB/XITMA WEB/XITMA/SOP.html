     <h2>STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"><strong>IT SECURITY POLICY GUIDELINES & OUTLINE SERVICE</strong></p>
      <ul class="paragraph">
        To develop a campus network infrastructure for the college, 
        we must consider connection,
         security, and equipment deployment across three buildings. 
        Here's a thorough method that 
        considers a variety of important factors, 
        including network topology and equipment selection, as well as
         security and maintenance practices.
        <li>
          <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Each user must authenticate with their unique credentials
           for both wired and wireless access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device Management:</strong> All devices must be registered 
          with the IT department,
           and unauthorized devices should be automatically blocked..
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Software and Firmware Updates: </strong>Regular updates for 
          all networking equipment
           (e.g., firewall, routers, and switches
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incident Response:</strong> Define a 
          response plan for breaches, including 
          isolation of affected devices and incident reporting protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Security:</strong> : Enforce 
          encryptions for all internal
           communications and sensitive data storage.
        </li>
        <strong>Network design and topology</strong>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Network Topology:</strong> The star topology is
           useful for linking several building
          s to a single network point (main building), which houses the 
          principal internet                        
          connection. Due to the distances involved, 
          we will connect buildings via fibre optic cables, 
          assuring minimal latency and high-speed connectivity.
        </li>
        <li>                                          
          <strong>Wifi Coverage</strong> Install Wi-Fi access points in each building's                                                                 
          lobby to ensure wireless access within a 200 square meter area.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wired Network</strong> Because each user has a device, we will install 
          structured cabling throughout each facility. Each building will have its 
          own local network, which is administered by a switch and connected to the main network via fibre optic cables.
          <p class="paragraph"><strong>IP address Schema and Management</strong></p>
              <li><strong> Using a private IP range</strong></li>Using a private IP range:
        	    Subnetting: We'll partition the IP address range into subnets depending on building groupings.
              Main building (30 users + 3 printers): 192.168.1.0/26 (maximum of 62 addresses)
             Building 1 (30 users + 3 printers): 192.168.1.64/26 (max. 62 addresses)   
               Building  2 (40 users + 3 printers): 192.168.1.128/26 (max. 62 addresses)
              Each network device will be assigned a unique IP address, and DHCP servers will be deployed in each 
              subnet to dynamically control IP address allocation. In addition, a DHCP server will be installed in the main building.
