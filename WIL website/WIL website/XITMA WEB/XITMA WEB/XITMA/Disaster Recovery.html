        <p class="paragraph"><strong>PREVENTIVE MEASURES</strong></p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
          <li>
            <strong> Malware prevention via detection software:</strong> It is
            imperative for any modern businesses and organizations to have a way
            to prevent and identify malware attacks. The malware software must
            always be updated and well maintained.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security awareness training:</strong> It is advised that
            there are regular security awareness training programs for
            employees. Various research indicates that these programs are very
            effective for the reduction of breaches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Policies and procedures: </strong>Policies and procedures
            that are clearly documented are important for ensuring that
            employees understand internal security controls. It also makes them
            aware of how dire carelessness is to the organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User access controls:</strong> Limiting who has access to
            certain data and information is an important security measure for
            the overall security of the organization. It is not advised that all
            employees have access to the same information that management has
            access to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software patching and updates:</strong> To keep the system
            running seamlessly the software patches must be well maintained.
            This will also keep the software operating at optimum levels.
          </li>
          <p class="paragraph"><strong>DETECTIVE MEASURES</strong></p>
             </li>
             <li><strong>Change control:</strong>
               Making spontaneous changes to the 
               system will increase the risk of vulnerabilities occurring. 
               This is why when making changes to the system there must be 
               enough planning done so that negative impacts are minimized. 
               Potential threats can be noticed by actively monitoring for 
               unauthorized changes made in the system.
               <li>
               <strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> Tests can be done regularly for
               security controls so that the system can remain secure.
               This way vulnerabilities will be identified early, and they can be delt with accordingly.
              </li> 
              
              </li>

              <li><strong>Incident Altering:</strong><strong></strong> Having the mechanisms that allow issues to be detected in a 
               timely manner ensures that an effective method to resolve the issue can be deployed. 
               The impact on an organization is determined by how quickly it is resolved. 
              </li>
